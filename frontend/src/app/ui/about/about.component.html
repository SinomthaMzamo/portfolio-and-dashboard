                    Hi, I’m a full-stack developer with a passion for building user-centered, 
                    cloud-powered web applications. With hands-on experience across design, 
                    frontend, backend, and cloud deployment, I take pride in turning ideas 
                    into scalable, well-crafted digital products. <br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve worked on 8+ projects, including a cloud-hosted developer portfolio and
                     community-centered platforms, and I recently completed a cloud development
                     track focused on AWS infrastructure. Whether I’m wireframing in Figma, architecting 
                     backend services, or deploying to S3 with CloudFormation, 
                     I value clean code, collaboration, and continuous learning.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    Let’s build something impactful.
