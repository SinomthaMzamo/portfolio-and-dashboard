			<div class="desc">My programming journey began with C# and Python textbooks, where I first explored
							 the magic of problem-solving through code. I built simple console applications and 
							 Windows Forms interfaces while uncovering the logic behind algorithms, data types, 
							 and control structures. Programming taught me that optimism is foundational — there's
							  always a solution.</div>
